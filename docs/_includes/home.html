  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Imagine walking into a lively bar, the air thick with conversation. Beer enthusiasts are swapping opinions, gesturing with half-full glasses as they debate the merits of a stout versus a lager. One table buzzes with excitement over a citrusy IPA, while another tells a story about an “angry and aggressive beer,” proudly exclaiming “Pilsners no longer scare me”! (text from RateBeer reviews).</p>
  <p>Now imagine trying to make sense of it all. Could we take the flood of reviews—millions of voices—and decode what people love and, more importantly, what they absolutely hate about beer?</p>
  <p>Understanding these dislikes allows breweries to refine their offerings, cater to broader audiences, and enhance their reputation by eliminating recurring complaints.</p>
  <p>That’s our mission. By diving into reviews, we’re not just chasing flavors; we’re tracking down frustrations, decoding complaints, and uncovering the secrets of beers that win hearts instead of breaking them.</p>
  <p>Our story begins with RateBeer, one of the largest hubs for beer enthusiasts. Over the years (our data covers the range 2001-2017), countless drinkers have shared their thoughts and opinions on this website. This treasure trove of reviews gives us an incredible opportunity to explore the world of beers through the eyes, taste buds, and words of the most dedicated fans. Each review is a tiny puzzle piece, and together, they form a picture of the beer world: the good, the bad, and the skunky.</p>
  <p>The main question we wish to answer here is then the following: Can Reviews Help Us Identify What People Hate?</p>
  <p>Let’s dive deeper into the data:</p>

  <h2>Exploring the Brew: Unveiling Insights from Beer Reviews</h2>
  <h4>The Experts: Who Holds the Mic?</h4>
  <p>Not all reviewers are created equal. Some leave one-liners, saying they enjoyed the beer, with little added detail. Others craft vivid descriptions that transport you straight into their tasting experience. Meet the experts—reviewers who’ve spent years tasting, documenting, and perfecting the art of beer critique. Let’s take a look at 3 reviews for the Canadian beer Dieu du Ciel Aphrodisiaque. Can you spot the outlier?</p>
  <p>"Wow, this is excellent! Pours a thick black with a tan head. Nose is toasted malt, vanilla, cocoa. Taste is more of these flavors, solid bitterness from the roasted malt and dark chocolate. Perfectly balanced."</p>
  <p>"Nice beer. Love the color and the scent. Very tasty. Goes down easily, very easily.---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone"</p>
  <p>"Strong chocolate, cocoa, vanilla, malt, a little dark fruit aroma. Tastes similar. Very velvety, smooth, roasted malt and cocoa chocolate."</p>
  <p>See the difference? Clearly, “tasty” “nice beer” is not as rich in information as “solid bitterness from the roasted malt and dark chocolate” or “a little dark fruit aroma.” The experts don’t just say what they feel; they explain why. Their precise vocabulary gives us depth and clarity in understanding what makes a beer shine or fail.</p>

  <h4>Extracting Key Features</h4>
  <p>So, what are people actually talking about? We break down reviews to reveal the most talked-about features of different beers. Our technique ensures that we extract characteristics that are specific to each beer and not vague terms like “good” or “bad.” Is this lager a little light-headed and slightly citrusy? Or is it haunted by a metallic aftertaste? Using this technique, we can extract patterns, uncovering, for example, the common characteristics of Belgian beers. “Overrated,” according to our reviewers. Imperial stouts? Burnt and roasty. Indian pale ales? Bland and soapy, but sometimes hoppy, sprucy, and even caramelly. Sounds nice, but let’s not lose sight of the prize and try to understand what people truly dislike—the deal-breakers, if you will.</p>

  <h2>Decoding complaints: The Language of Discontent</h2>

  <h4>The Language of Negativity</h4>
  <p>Let’s face it, nobody likes hearing complaints, but for brewers, negative feedback can be a goldmine of insight. We separate the bad from the good by identifying reviews dripping with dissatisfaction: a bad rating, a sour tone, or even implied fear. Again, we want specifics, avoiding vague complaints like “not great” to focus on specifics like “the taste is missing most of the coconut.”</p>
  <p>Our approach compares the prevalence of words in a beer’s positive reviews compared to its negative reviews using term-frequency-inverse-document-frequency (tf-idf) analysis.</p>

  <h4>Emotions in Reviews</h4>
  <p>Sometimes, it’s not just what reviewers say but how they say it. Reviews can carry powerful emotions, from joy to anger, and even despair! By analyzing the implied emotional state of the reviewer, we can find reviews where the frustration is palpable, whether it’s the anger of spending money on a dud or the sadness of a once-favorite being disappointing.</p>
  <p>The previous approach of comparing high-rated and low-rated reviews works well for identifying more obvious criticisms, as low-rated reviews tend to be straightforward and direct about negative feedback. We use an emotion analysis model specifically on high-rated reviews because these reviews often contain subtle or mixed feedback. For example, a positive review might include some constructive criticism, but it can be harder to spot since the overall tone is positive. The emotion analysis model helps us identify these hidden emotions or critiques within the positive feedback, by analyzing sentence by sentence.</p>
  <p>We used a machine learning tool to analyze the emotions in reviews. We could determine the overall emotion expressed in each review by giving the reviews to a model called <a href="https://huggingface.co/j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base">Emotion English DistilRoBERTa-base</a>. Reviews can sometimes be neutral and descriptive or more opinionated and emotional. The model gives us the prevalence of emotions, so we can focus on specific emotions, even if they’re not the strongest ones. The model is trained to recognize seven emotions: joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, neutral, and disgust. These categories give us a clear picture of the emotional tone of review sentences.</p>
