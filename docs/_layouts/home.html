        <h1>Beer Review Analysis: What Drives Negativity?</h1>

        <section id="Emotions_in_Reviews">
            <h2>Emotions in Reviews</h2>
            <p>Reviews of beer, like any product, are filled with emotion. Some are positive, some negative, but they all reveal something important about how consumers interact with the product. In the case of beer reviews, we notice distinct emotional patterns. As you'd expect, negative emotions like disgust and sadness show up more in low-rated reviews, while positive emotions like joy are more common in high-rated reviews. To study this further, we compare review sentences that express disgust and sadness with those that show joy and neutral emotions.</p>

        <section id="Following_the_Clues" style="padding: 20px; font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">
            <h2 style="font-size: 32px; font-weight: 700; color: #1a202c;">Following the Clues: What Drives Negativity?</h2>
            <h4 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 700; color: #e53e3e;">What Exactly Irritates Beer Reviewers?</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; color: #4a5568;">Is it the appearance, the aroma, the palate, or the taste? A combination of these? We use the classification model <strong>BART-large-MNLI</strong> to organize the criticisms by category, helping us pinpoint the exact source of dissatisfaction. Whether it’s the cloudy appearance of a beer, a hint of stale aroma, an unpleasant aftertaste, or an overly bitter mouthfeel, we break down which aspects of beer irk reviewers the most.</p>

            <h4 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 700; color: #e53e3e;">Geographical and Style-Based Criticisms</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; color: #4a5568;">Emboldened by our newly acquired knowledge about criticisms, we can now attempt to identify each country’s common weak points in beer production. Are certain countries known for producing overly bitter beers, while others fail to balance sweetness properly? And what about beer styles—do IPAs frequently draw complaints about bitterness, while stouts are criticized for being too heavy? We explore the main criticisms of each beer style and look for patterns that emerge. Interactive visualizations help us examine these findings and draw conclusions based on the data. What patterns can you identify?</p>

        <section id="Conclusion" style="padding: 20px; font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;">
            <h2 style="font-size: 32px; font-weight: 700; color: #1a202c;">Conclusion</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; color: #4a5568;">By understanding the language used in beer reviews, we’re able to shed light on the complaints that most frustrate drinkers. Complaints are often a direct reaction to a beer’s flaws, and by analyzing these responses in-depth, breweries can improve the customer experience. By identifying specific dislikes, brewers can avoid creating the kinds of beers that reviewers find unappealing, leading to more successful beers that have the potential to be appreciated by a wide range of customers.</p>
            
            <h4 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 700; color: #e53e3e;">Brewing Beer: An Art and a Science</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; color: #4a5568;">Brewing beer is as much an art as it is a science, and no brewery gets it right every time. But by listening to what drinkers hate—and why—they can avoid common pitfalls. From over-carbonated disasters to flavor profiles that miss the mark, our analysis shines a light on the pain points reviewers report. These insights help breweries avoid the mistakes that lead to poor reviews, refining their craft and improving their offerings.</p>

            <h4 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 700; color: #e53e3e;">The Power of Collective Feedback</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; color: #4a5568;">In the end, a single review is just an opinion. But a collection of reviews is a roadmap to better beer. By decoding complaints and understanding emotions, we help ensure that the next pint is one worth savoring. Cheers to that!</p>
