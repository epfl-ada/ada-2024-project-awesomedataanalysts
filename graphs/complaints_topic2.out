Final Summary of All Complaints:
The Only Peachy color and half cloudy look lingering and piney quite a hoppy nose . Pours a hazy amber color with a dense off white head but not great stuff! The cask version is more dry hopped and the mouthfeel is much more oily . The taste is very pungently bitter but this was hugely unbalanced Amber beer .
